        A blog for some miniature terrain pieces I made for our D&D campaign a
        few years ago. I show the process for building process for each piece,
        so the posts are very image heavy. I built this blog with Gatsby, mostly
        to take advantage of its convenient image features.

        When my husband and I started our own D&D campaign with our friends, we
        were all completely new to tabletop games. We went all out on our setup
        and atmosphere, and I had a blast learning to build miniature
        environments for our dungeons. This blog was a great place for our play
        group to come and see what went into the pieces that we played with.

            Gatsby's image plugin uses a blur-up technique; it creates tiny
            images from the source images and displays them while the full size
            images load. It's less jarring than being shown a solid color
            followed by an image, and it helps the page load to feel faster. It
            also prevents cumulative layout shift (CLS) so the content doesn't
            move around unexpectedly during load time.
          </p>

            Gatsby image uses lazy loading by default, which is crucial for the
            posts on this site, as each of them has 20-50 high resolution photos
            on a single page. Another nice optimization that it takes care of
            for you is creating the different resolutions of your images for
            different screen sizes,

            Gatsby's image plugin does so many things for you out of the box,

            Gatsby also has a &lt;Link&gt; component that prefetches the
            resources for the pages that are linked to when the link enters the
            viewport or is moused over, so navigating around feels super fast.
